            <p>The accepted Lorem Ipsum text is inherently messy. It has different character ratios and prevalent digraphs. The words are foreign to most of us, so they attract attention. There's barely any interesting formatting, because Cicero didn't have hyperlinks.

            <p>Englipsum solves those problems.

            <p>It generates grammatically-valid English that makes sense in context. It looks right, thus allowing itself to be ignored. Englipsum pays attention to the little details that make text natural-looking: liberal punctuation usage, emphasis, and embedded links. The default dictionary includes words found on most tech sites.
