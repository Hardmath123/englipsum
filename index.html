            <p>The accepted Lorem Ipsum text is inherently messy. It has different character frequencies, popular digraphs, punctuation patterns, and word lengths. The words are foreign to most of us and attract attention. There's barely any interesting formatting, because Cicero didn't have hyperlinks.

            <p>Englipsum solves those problems.

            <p>It generates grammatically-valid English that makes sense in context (beating most humans at English). It looks right, allowing itself to be ignored. Englipsum pays attention to the little details that make text natural-looking: liberal punctuation usage, emphasis, and embedded links.
